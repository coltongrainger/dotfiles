# As a cautionary note. You should never add to this list programs that may have bad effect on your system. For example adding an entry for application/x-sh (for a shell script) is a bad idea, as that could perfectly be a virus, and you certainly do not need to get infected by one. For the same reason, you should not associate a program to the file type application/octet-stream.
