It presents a set of mathematical tools to analyse the structure and to establish the stability of such modules, providing a sound mathematical framework for the study of persistence diagrams. Completely self-contained, this brief introduces the notion of persistence measure and makes extensive use of a new calculus of quiver representations to facilitate explicit computations. Appealing to both beginners and experts in the subject, The Structure and Stability of Persistence Modules provides a purely algebraic presentation of persistence, and thus complements the existing literature, which focuses mainly on topological and algorithmic aspects.},

This improves the O(log n)-approximation of Leighton and Rao (1988). We use a well-known semidefinite relaxation with triangle inequality constraints. Central to our analysis is a geometric theorem about projections of point sets in R d , whose proof makes essential use of a phenomenon called measure concentration. We also describe an interesting and natural "certificate" for a graph's expansion, by embedding an n-node expander in it with appropriate dilation and congestion. We call this an expander flow.},

  title = {On the Power of Unique 2-Prover 1-Round Games},
  isbn = {1-58113-495-9},
  abstract = {A 2-prover game is called unique if the answer of one prover uniquely determines the answer of the second prover and vice versa (we implicitly assume games to be one round games). The value of a 2-prover game is the maximum acceptance probability of the verifier over all the prover strategies. We make the following conjecture regarding the power of unique 2-prover games, which we call the Unique Games Conjecture:(MATH) The Unique Games Conjecture: For arbitrarily small constants \$ \textbackslash{} \textbackslash{}zeta, \textbackslash{} \textbackslash{}delta {$>$} 0\$, there exists a constant \$k = k(\textbackslash{}zeta,\textbackslash{}delta)\$ such that it is NP-hard to determine whether a unique 2-prover game with answers from a domain of size \$k\$ has value at least \$1-\textbackslash{}zeta\$ or at most \$\textbackslash{}delta\$. \textbackslash{}medskip.(MATH) We show that a positive resolution of this conjecture would imply the following hardness results:For any \$\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{2\} {$<$} t {$<$} 1\$, for all sufficiently small constants \$\textbackslash{}epsilon {$>$} 0\$, it is NP-hard to distinguish between the instances of the problem 2-Linear-Equations mod 2 where either there exists an assignment that satisfies \$1-\textbackslash{}epsilon\$ fraction of equations or no assignment can satisfy more than \$1-\textbackslash{}epsilon\^t\$ fraction of equations. As a corollary of the above result, it is NP-hard to approximate the Min-2CNF-deletion problem within any constant factor.For the constraint satisfaction problem where every constraint is the predicate Not-all-equal(\$a,b,c\$), \$ \textbackslash{} a, b, c \textbackslash{}in GF(3) \textbackslash{} \$, it is NP-hard to distinguish between the instances where either there exists an assignment that satisfies \$1-\textbackslash{}epsilon\$ fraction of the constraints or no assignment satisfies more than \$\textbackslash{}frac\{8\}\{9\}+\textbackslash{}epsilon\$ fraction of the constraints for an arbitrarily small constant \$\textbackslash{}epsilon {$>$} 0\$. We also get a hardness result for a slight variation of approximate coloring of 3-uniform hypergraphs..(MATH) We also show that a variation of the Unique Games Conjecture implies that for arbitrarily small constant \$\textbackslash{}delta {$>$} 0\$ it is hard to find an independent set of size \$\textbackslash{}delta n\$ in a graph that is guaranteed to have an independent set of size \$\textbackslash{}Omega(n)\$.The main idea in all the above results is to use the 2-prover game given by the Unique Games Conjecture as an "outer verifier" and build new probabilistically checkable proof systems (PCPs) on top of it. The uniqueness property plays a crucial role in the analysis of these PCPs.(MATH) In light of such interesting consequences, we think it is an important open problem to prove (or disprove) the Unique Games Conjecture. We also present a semi-definite programming based algorithm for finding reasonable prover strategies for a unique 2-prover game. Given a unique 2-prover game with value \$1-\textbackslash{}zeta\$ and answers from a domain of size \$k\$, this algorithm finds prover strategies that make the verifier accept with probability \$1-O(k\^2 \textbackslash{}zeta\^\{1/5\} \textbackslash{}sqrt\{\textbackslash{}log (\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{\textbackslash{}zeta\})\})\$. This result shows that the domain size \$k = k(\textbackslash{}zeta, \textbackslash{}delta)\$ must be sufficiently large if the Unique Games Conjecture is true.},

  title = {Generating {{Language}}-{{Based Environments}}},
  abstract = {This thesis concerns the design of interactive, language-based programming environments that use knowledge of a programming language to provide functions based on the structure and meaning of programs. The goal of the research is a system-constructor to enable editors for different languages to be created easily.

The most challenging aspect of such a system is the design of the semantic component, because a language-based editor performs static semantic analysis when a program is altered in order to detect erroneous constructions or to prevent illegal modifications. For efficiency, this should be performed incrementally, re-using as much old information as possible; therefore, a major focus of my research concerns a model of editing for which it is possible to perform incremental semantic analysis efficiently.

In this model, a program is represented as an attributed tree in which all attributes have consistent values; programs are modified by tree operations such as pruning, grafting, and deriving. After each modification, some of the attributes require new values; incremental semantic analysis is performed by updating attribute values to again make them all consistent. The thesis presents several algorithms for this process that are asymptotically optimal in time.

The chief disadvantage of attribute grammars is that they use large amounts of storage. The thesis discusses three aspects of utilizing storage efficiently in such systems. One way to reduce the amount of storage used is to reduce the number of attribute values retained at any stage of attribute evaluation. The thesis establishes two results concerning this idea: it presents one algorithm for evaluating an n-attribute tree that never saves more than O(n**1/2) attribute values, and it presents a second algorithm that never saves more than O(log n) attribute values. A second method for reducing the amount of storage is to share the space used for storing attributes whose values are complex data structures; the thesis presents a very general method for such sharing that can be applied to attributes of many types. Finally, the thesis describes how, by restricting the class of attribute grammars, it is possible to reduce the amount of storage overhead required for updating trees in optimal time.},

  volume = {21},

  abstract = {Conventional programming languages are growing ever more enormous, but not stronger. Inherent defects at the most basic level cause them to be both fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from their common ancestor\textemdash{}the von Neumann computer, their close coupling of semantics to state transitions, their division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful combining forms for building new programs from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs.An alternative functional style of programming is founded on the use of combining forms for creating programs. Functional programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure declarations to become generally applicable. Combining forms can use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.Associated with the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose ``unknowns'' are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school algebra. These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written. Combining forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also for the power of their associated algebraic laws. General theorems of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs.A new class of computing systems uses the functional programming style both in its programming language and in its state transition rules. Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems have semantics loosely coupled to states\textemdash{}only one state transition occurs per major computation.},

In China, it is very difficult for individuals to access electronic health records.

In this paper, we propose a practical approach to extract structured data from printed medical records photographed by mobile phones. An optical character recognition (OCR) pipeline is performed to recognize text in a document photo, which addresses the problems of low image quality and content complexity by image pre-processing and multiple OCR engine synthesis. A series of annotation algorithms that support flexible layouts are then used to identify the document type, entities of interest, and entity correlations, from which a structured PHR document is built. The proposed approach was applied to real world medical records to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability.},

Our extraction pipeline is based on natural language processing (NLP) and supervised text classification methods. To develop and test the pipeline, we created a corpus of 800 radiology reports double annotated for recommendation sentences by a radiologist and an internist. We ran several experiments to measure the impact of different feature types and the data imbalance between positive and negative recommendation sentences.

  title = {Preventing Occupational Stress in Healthcare Workers},
  abstract = {Background Healthcare workers can suffer from occupational stress as a result of lack of skills, organisational factors, and low social support at work. This may lead to distress, burnout and psychosomatic problems, and deterioration in quality of life and service provision. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of work- and person-directed interventions compared to no intervention or alternative interventions in preventing stress at work in healthcare workers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, NIOSHTIC-2 and Web of Science up to November 2013. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions aimed at preventing psychological stress in healthcare workers. For organisational interventions, interrupted time-series and controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies were also eligible. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We used Standardised Mean Differences (SMDs) where authors of trials used different scales to measure stress or burnout. We combined studies that were similar in meta-analyses. We used the GRADE system to rate the quality of the evidence. Main results In this update, we added 39 studies, making a total of 58 studies (54 RCTs and four CBA studies), with 7188 participants. We categorised interventions as cognitive-behavioural training (CBT) (n = 14), mental and physical relaxation (n = 21), combined CBT and relaxation (n = 6) and organisational interventions (n = 20). Follow-up was less than one month in 24 studies, one to six in 22 studies and more than six months in 12 studies. We categorised outcomes as stress, anxiety or general health. There was low-quality evidence that CBT with or without relaxation was no more effective in reducing stress symptoms than no intervention at one month follow-up in six studies (SMD -0.27 (95\% Confidence Interval (CI) -0.66 to 0.13; 332 participants). But at one to six months follow-up in seven studies (SMD -0.38, 95\% CI -0.59 to -0.16; 549 participants, 13\% relative risk reduction), and at more than six months follow-up in two studies (SMD -1.04, 95\% CI -1.37 to -0.70; 157 participants) CBT with or without relaxation reduced stress more than no intervention. CBT interventions did not lead to a considerably greater effect than an alternative intervention, in three studies. Physical relaxation (e.g. massage) was more effective in reducing stress than no intervention at one month follow-up in four studies (SMD -0.48, 95\% CI -0.89 to -0.08; 97 participants) and at one to six months follow-up in six studies (SMD -0.47; 95\% CI -0.70 to -0.24; 316 participants). Two studies did not find a considerable difference in stress between massage and taking extra breaks. Mental relaxation (e.g. meditation) led to similar stress symptom levels as no intervention at one to six months follow-up in six studies (SMD -0.50, 95\% CI -1.15 to 0.15; 205 participants) but to less stress in one study at more than six months follow-up. One study showed that mental relaxation reduced stress more effectively than attending a course on theory analysis and another that it was more effective than just relaxing in a chair. Organisational interventions consisted of changes in working conditions, organising support, changing care, increasing communication skills and changing work schedules. Changing work schedules (from continuous to having weekend breaks and from a four-week to a two-week schedule) reduced stress with SMD -0.55 (95\% CI -0.84 to -0.25; 2 trials, 180 participants). Other organisational interventions were not more effective than no intervention or an alternative intervention. We graded the quality of the evidence for all but one comparison as low. For CBT this was due to the possibility of publication bias, and for the other comparisons to a lack of precision and risk of bias. Only for relaxation versus no intervention was the evidence of moderate quality. Authors' conclusions There is low-quality evidence that CBT and mental and physical relaxation reduce stress more than no intervention but not more than alternative interventions. There is also low-quality evidence that changing work schedules may lead to a reduction of stress. Other organisational interventions have no effect on stress levels. More randomised controlled trials are needed with at least 120 participants that compare the intervention to a placebo-like intervention. Organisational interventions need better focus on reduction of specific stressors.},

It reaches equivalent test accuracies after the same number of training epochs, but with fewer parameter updates, leading to greater parallelism and shorter training times. We can further reduce the number of parameter updates by increasing the learning rate \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\$ and scaling the batch size \$B \textbackslash{}propto \textbackslash{}epsilon\$. Finally, one can increase the momentum coefficient \$m\$ and scale \$B \textbackslash{}propto 1/(1-m)\$, although this tends to slightly reduce the test accuracy. Crucially, our techniques allow us to repurpose existing training schedules for large batch training with no hyper-parameter tuning.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

In particular, the perspectives of (elementary) homological algebra, in the form of complexes and co/homological invariants are sketched. Beginning with simplicial and cell complexes as a means of enriching graphs to higher-order structures, we define simple algebraic topological invariants, such as Euler characteristic. By lifting from complexes of simplices to algebraic complexes of vector spaces, we pass to homology as a topological compression scheme. Iterating this process of expanding to sequences and compressing via homological algebra, we define persistent homology and related theories, ending with a simple approach to cellular sheaves and their cohomology. Throughout, an emphasis is placed on expressing homological-algebraic tools as the natural evolution of linear algebra. Category-theoretic language (though more natural and expressive) is deemphasized, for the sake of access. Along the way, sample applications of these techniques are sketched, in domains ranging from neuroscience to sensing, image analysis, robotics, and computation.},

  abstract = {Restricted Boltzmann machines were developed using binary stochastic hidden units. These can be generalized by replacing each binary unit by an infinite number of copies that all have the same weights but have progressively more negative biases. The learning and inference rules for these "Stepped Sigmoid Units" are unchanged. They can be approximated efficiently by noisy, rectified linear units. Compared with binary units, these units learn features that are better for object recognition on the NORB dataset and face verification on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset. Unlike binary units, rectified linear units preserve information about relative intensities as information travels through multiple layers of feature detectors.},

  abstract = {The learnability of different neural architectures can be characterized directly by computable measures of data complexity. In this paper, we reframe the problem of architecture selection as understanding how data determines the most expressive and generalizable architectures suited to that data, beyond inductive bias. After suggesting algebraic topology as a measure for data complexity, we show that the power of a network to express the topological complexity of a dataset in its decision region is a strictly limiting factor in its ability to generalize. We then provide the first empirical characterization of the topological capacity of neural networks. Our empirical analysis shows that at every level of dataset complexity, neural networks exhibit topological phase transitions. This observation allowed us to connect existing theory to empirically driven conjectures on the choice of architectures for fully-connected neural networks.},

  volume = {3},
  issn = {2475-9066},
  shorttitle = {{{TDAstats}}},
  abstract = {High-dimensional datasets are becoming more common in a variety of scientific fields. Well-known examples include next-generation sequencing in biology, patient health status in medicine, and computer vision in deep learning. Dimension reduction, using methods like principal component analysis (PCA), is a common preprocessing step for such datasets. However, while dimension reduction can save computing and human resources, it comes with the cost of significant information loss. Topological data analysis (TDA) aims to analyze the ``shape'' of high-dimensional datasets, without dimension reduction, by extracting features that are robust to small perturbations in data. Persistent features of a dataset can be used to describe it, and to compare it to other datasets. Visualization of persistent features can be done using topological barcodes or persistence diagrams (Figure 1). Application of TDA methods has granted greater insight into high-dimensional data (Lakshmikanth et al., 2017); one prominent example of this is its use to characterize a clinically relevant subgroup of breast cancer patients (Nicolau, Levine, \& Carlsson, 2011). This is a particularly salient study as Nicolau et al. (2011) used a topological method, termed Progression Analysis of Disease, to identify a patient subgroup with 100\% survival using that remains invisible to other clustering methods. The TDAstats R package is a comprehensive pipeline for conducting TDA. Once data is loaded into R, TDAstats can calculate, visualize, and conduct nonparametric statistical inference on persistent homology. The Ripser C++ library (Bauer, 2015), benchmarked at approximately 40 times faster than comparable software, is wrapped using Rcpp (Eddelbuettel \& Francois, 2011) for efficient computation of persistent homology. TDAstats generates topological barcodes and persistence diagrams using the ubiquitous ggplot2 library (Wickham, 2016), allowing use of ggplot2 functions to manipulate plots. This reduces the number of manual steps required to prepare publication-quality figures, thus enabling reproducible research (Sandve, Nekrutenko, Taylor, \& Hovig, 2013). TDAstats also implements nonparametric hypothesis testing of persistent homology using a permutation test, first described by Robinson \& Turner (2017). The permutation test uses statistical resampling to approximate the distribution of the test statistic assuming the null hypothesis is true. To our knowledge, TDAstats is the first library to implement this feature in the context of topological data analysis.},

These models are dynamical systems describing the movement of agents who interact via alignment, attraction, and/or repulsion. Each simulation time frame is a point cloud in position-velocity space. We analyze the topological structure of these point clouds, interpreting the persistent homology by calculating the first few Betti numbers. These Betti numbers count connected components, topological circles, and trapped volumes present in the data. To interpret our results, we introduce a visualization that displays Betti numbers over simulation time and topological persistence scale. We compare our topological results to order parameters typically used to quantify the global behavior of aggregations, such as polarization and angular momentum. The topological calculations reveal events and structure not captured by the order parameters.},

Despite their popularity and widespread use, there are still many aspects of training and classification that are not well understood. In this paper we aim to provide some new insights into training and classification by analyzing neural networks from a feature-space perspective. We review and explain the formation of decision regions and study some of their combinatorial aspects. We place a particular emphasis on the connections between the neural network weight and bias terms and properties of decision boundaries and other regions that exhibit varying levels of classification confidence. We show how the error backpropagates in these regions and emphasize the important role they have in the formation of gradients. These findings expose the connections between scaling of the weight parameters and the density of the training samples. This sheds more light on the vanishing gradient problem, explains the need for regularization, and suggests an approach for subsampling training data to improve performance.},

  title = {Estimating {{Information Flow}} in {{Neural Networks}}},
  abstract = {We study the flow of information and the evolution of internal representations during deep neural network (DNN) training, aiming to demystify the compression aspect of the information bottleneck theory. The theory suggests that DNN training comprises a rapid fitting phase followed by a slower compression phase, in which the mutual information \$I(X;T)\$ between the input \$X\$ and internal representations \$T\$ decreases. Several papers observe compression of estimated mutual information on different DNN models, but the true \$I(X;T)\$ over these networks is provably either constant (discrete \$X\$) or infinite (continuous \$X\$). This work explains the discrepancy between theory and experiments, and clarifies what was actually measured by these past works. To this end, we introduce an auxiliary (noisy) DNN framework for which \$I(X;T)\$ is a meaningful quantity that depends on the network's parameters. This noisy framework is shown to be a good proxy for the original (deterministic) DNN both in terms of performance and the learned representations. We then develop a rigorous estimator for \$I(X;T)\$ in noisy DNNs and observe compression in various models. By relating \$I(X;T)\$ in the noisy DNN to an information-theoretic communication problem, we show that compression is driven by the progressive clustering of hidden representations of inputs from the same class. Several methods to directly monitor clustering of hidden representations, both in noisy and deterministic DNNs, are used to show that meaningful clusters form in the \$T\$ space. Finally, we return to the estimator of \$I(X;T)\$ employed in past works, and demonstrate that while it fails to capture the true (vacuous) mutual information, it does serve as a measure for clustering. This clarifies the past observations of compression and isolates the geometric clustering of hidden representations as the true phenomenon of interest.},

  abstract = {Homotopy type theory is an extension of Martin-L{\"o}f type theory, based on a correspondence with homotopy theory and higher category theory. In homotopy type theory, the propositional equality type becomes proof-relevant, and corresponds to paths in a space. This allows for a new class of datatypes, called higher inductive types, which are specified by constructors not only for points but also for paths. In this paper, we consider a programming application of higher inductive types. Version control systems such as Darcs are based on the notion of patches\textemdash{}syntactic representations of edits to a repository. We show how patch theory can be developed in homotopy type theory. Our formulation separates formal theories of patches from their interpretation as edits to repositories. A patch theory is presented as a higher inductive type. Models of a patch theory are given by maps out of that type, which, being functors, automatically preserve the structure of patches. Several standard tools of homotopy theory come into play, demonstrating the use of these methods in a practical programming context.},

  abstract = {Student Engagement in Mathematics through an Institutional Network for Active Learning (SEMINAL) is a five-year IUSE grant from NSF (2016-2021). The goal of SEMINAL is to stimulate and better understand how to enact and support institutional change aimed at implementing active learning in undergraduate mathematics learning environments, focusing in particular on large-enrollment entry courses: precalculus to calculus 2 (P2C2). SEMINAL is being carried out in two phases. Phase 1 consists of case studies at six institutions that have a record of successfully implementing Active Learning Mathematics (ALM). These institutions were selected to represent different institutional settings and diverse student demographics. Phase 2 consists of longitudinal, incentivized case studies of nine diverse institutions that will infuse active learning into the P2C2 sequence. Overall, Phase 1 will offer the field a retrospective account of ALM models of change that worked. Phase 2 will develop theory and insights into the processes by which change focused on ALM can unfold over time, along with affordances and constraints related to institutional change. Phase 1 data collection was completed in spring 2017, including site visits to the six targeted mathematics departments. In this article, we share both SEMINAL's theory of change for mathematics departments, and preliminary findings from the recent site visits. We discuss emerging features and aspects of the departmental cultures at these six institutions and ways in which the research of and support for ALM in the P2C2 sequence addresses the mission of the MTE-Partnership.},

  title = {Some {{Fundamental Theorems}} in {{Mathematics}}},
  abstract = {An expository hitchhikers guide to some theorems in mathematics. Criteria for the current list of 164 theorems are whether the result can be formulated elegantly, whether it is beautiful or useful and whether it could serve as a guide [5] without leading to panic. The order is not a ranking but more like a time-line when things were written down. Since [316] stated ``a mathematical theorem only becomes beautiful if presented as a crown jewel within a context'' we try sometimes to give some context. Of course, any such list of theorems is a matter of personal preferences, taste and limitations. The number of theorems is arbitrary, the initial obvious goal was 42 but that number got eventually surpassed as it is hard to stop, once started. As a compensation, there are 42 ``tweetable'' theorems with included proofs. More comments on the choice of the theorems is included in an epilogue. For literature on general mathematics, see [119, 115, 20, 141, 151, 355, 240, 84], for history [133, 359, 217, 44, 33, 125, 219, 211, 393, 68, 354, 48, 154, 196], for popular, beautiful or elegant things [8, 302, 122, 110, 13, 382, 383, 31, ?, 116, 146, 255, 352, 122, 1, 76, 91, 77, 287].

These generalizations of curves and surfaces to arbitrarily many dimensions provide the mathematical context for under\- standing "space" in all of its manifestations. Today, the tools of manifold theory are indispensable in most major subfields of pure mathematics, and outside of pure mathematics they are becoming increasingly important to scientists in such diverse fields as genetics, robotics, econometrics, com\- puter graphics, biomedical imaging, and, of course, the undisputed leader among consumers (and inspirers) of mathematics-theoretical physics. No longer a specialized subject that is studied only by differential geometers, manifold theory is now one of the basic skills that all mathematics students should acquire as early as possible. Over the past few centuries, mathematicians have developed a wondrous collection of conceptual machines designed to enable us to peer ever more deeply into the invisible world of geometry in higher dimensions. Once their operation is mastered, these powerful machines enable us to think geometrically about the 6-dimensional zero set of a polynomial in four complex variables, or the lO-dimensional manifold of 5 x 5 orthogonal ma\- trices, as easily as we think about the familiar 2-dimensional sphere in ]R3.},

  abstract = {The golden age of mathematics-that was not the age of Euclid, it is ours. C. J. KEYSER This time of writing is the hundredth anniversary of the publication (1892) of Poincare's first note on topology, which arguably marks the beginning of the subject of algebraic, or "combinatorial," topology. There was earlier scattered work by Euler, Listing (who coined the word "topology"), Mobius and his band, Riemann, Klein, and Betti. Indeed, even as early as 1679, Leibniz indicated the desirability of creating a geometry of the topological type. The establishment of topology (or "analysis situs" as it was often called at the time) as a coherent theory, however, belongs to Poincare. Curiously, the beginning of general topology, also called "point set topology," dates fourteen years later when Frechet published the first abstract treatment of the subject in 1906. Since the beginning of time, or at least the era of Archimedes, smooth manifolds (curves, surfaces, mechanical configurations, the universe) have been a central focus in mathematics. They have always been at the core of interest in topology. After the seminal work of Milnor, Smale, and many others, in the last half of this century, the topological aspects of smooth manifolds, as distinct from the differential geometric aspects, became a subject in its own right.},

The four main chapters present the basic material of the subject: fundamental group and covering spaces, homology and cohomology, higher homotopy groups, and homotopy theory generally. The author emphasizes the geometric aspects of the subject, which helps students gain intuition. A unique feature of the book is the inclusion of many optional topics which are not usually part of a first course due to time constraints, and for which elementary expositions are sometimes hard to find. Among these are: Bockstein and transfer homomorphisms, direct and inverse limits, H-spaces and Hopf algebras, the Brown representability theorem, the James reduced product, the Dold-Thom theorem, and a full exposition of Steenrod squares and powers. Researchers will also welcome this aspect of the book.},

At the most basic level, the book gives an introduction to the basic concepts which are used in differential topology, differential geometry, and differential equations. In differential topology, one studies for instance homotopy classes of maps and the possibility of finding suitable differen\- tiable maps in them (immersions, embeddings, isomorphisms, etc. ). One may also use differentiable structures on topological manifolds to deter\- mine the topological structure of the manifold (for example, it la Smale [Sm 67]). In differential geometry, one puts an additional structure on the differentiable manifold (a vector field, a spray, a 2-form, a Riemannian metric, ad lib. ) and studies properties connected especially with these objects. Formally, one may say that one studies properties invariant under the group of differentiable automorphisms which preserve the additional structure. In differential equations, one studies vector fields and their in\- tegral curves, singular points, stable and unstable manifolds, etc. A certain number of concepts are essential for all three, and are so basic and elementary that it is worthwhile to collect them together so that more advanced expositions can be given without having to start from the very beginnings.},

  abstract = {This English edition could serve as a text for a first year graduate course on differential geometry, as did for a long time the Chicago Notes of Chern mentioned in the Preface to the German Edition. Suitable references for ordin\- ary differential equations are Hurewicz, W. Lectures on ordinary differential equations. MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1958, and for the topology of surfaces: Massey, Algebraic Topology, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1977. Upon David Hoffman fell the difficult task of transforming the tightly constructed German text into one which would mesh well with the more relaxed format of the Graduate Texts in Mathematics series. There are some e1aborations and several new figures have been added. I trust that the merits of the German edition have survived whereas at the same time the efforts of David helped to elucidate the general conception of the Course where we tried to put Geometry before Formalism without giving up mathematical rigour. 1 wish to thank David for his work and his enthusiasm during the whole period of our collaboration. At the same time I would like to commend the editors of Springer-Verlag for their patience and good advice.

Beginning with basic concepts such as diffeomorphisms and smooth manifolds, he goes on to examine tangent spaces, oriented manifolds, and vector fields. Key concepts such as homotopy, the index number of a map, and the Pontryagin construction are discussed. The author presents proofs of Sard's theorem and the Hopf theorem.},

  abstract = {Michael Spivak (b. 1940) is an American differential geometer and expositor of mathematics.~ In addition to this current volume (1965), he is also well known for his introductory but rigorous textbook Calculus (1967, 4th ed. 2008) and five-volume magnum opus A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry (1979, 3rd ed. 1999).

Within a brief 146 pages, Calculus on Manifolds: A Modern Approach to Classical Theorems of Advanced Calculus gives a rigorous account of multivariable calculus.~ The first three chapters examine functions in Euclidean space and the generalization of differential and integral calculus to functions f: Rn\textrightarrowRm.~ The final two chapters develop the modern machinery of differential forms and the exterior calculus to state and prove a sweeping generalization of the theorems of vector calculus, the generalized Stokes' theorem for manifolds-with-boundary.~ The classical theorems of Cauchy-Green, Ostrogradsky-Gauss, and Kelvin-Stokes alluded to in the subtitle are restated and proved as immediate corollaries thereof.~ 

This volume is aimed at the student who has completed at least one year of one-variable calculus and a term of linear algebra and who has, in the author's words, a certain "rapport with abstract mathematics."~ By presenting the contents of a third-term calculus course as seen by a modern mathematician, Spivak introduces the student to some of the language and concepts of differential geometry, allowing this text to serve as a prelude to his grand treatise on the subject.},

We lay some emphasis on the connection between the path integral motivation and the definition in terms symmetric monoidal categories, and we highlight the algebraic formulation emerging from a formal generators-and-relations description. This allows one to understand (oriented, closed) 1- and 2-dimensional TQFTs in terms of a finite amount of algebraic data, while already the 3-dimensional case needs an infinite amount of data. We evade these complications by instead discussing some aspects of 3-dimensional extended TQFTs, and their relation to braided monoidal categories.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous computing with accelerators is growing in importance in high performance computing (HPC). Recently, application datasets have expanded beyond the memory capacity of these accelerators, and often beyond the capacity of their hosts. Meanwhile, nonvolatile memory (NVM) storage has emerged as a pervasive component in HPC systems because NVM provides massive amounts of memory capacity at affordable cost. Currently, for accelerator applications to use NVM, they must manually orchestrate data movement across multiple memories and this approach only performs well for applications with simple access behaviors. To address this issue, we developed DRAGON, a solution that enables all classes of GP-GPU applications to transparently compute on terabyte datasets residing in NVM. DRAGON leverages the page-faulting mechanism on the recent NVIDIA GPUs by extending capabilities of CUDA Unified Memory (UM). Our experimental results show that DRAGON transparently expands memory capacity and obtain additional speedups via automated I/O and data transfer overlapping.},

We quantify the rebound, the implications on water temperature and customer satisfaction and, using a co-simulation framework, we also estimate the impact on the feeder voltage. Our results show that, with a large customer participation (75\%), we can deduce the peak by as much as 25\%, but there are trade-offs between customer satisfaction and the rebound effects on both energy use and voltage.},

  abstract = {The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project is an international effort to produce a comprehensive global atmospheric circulation dataset spanning the twentieth century, assimilating only surface pressure reports and using observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as boundary conditions. It is chiefly motivated by a need to provide an observational dataset with quantified uncertainties for validations of climate model simulations of the twentieth century on all time-scales, with emphasis on the statistics of daily weather. It uses an Ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation method with background `first guess' fields supplied by an ensemble of forecasts from a global numerical weather prediction model. This directly yields a global analysis every 6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere, and also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis. The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of global tropospheric variability, and of the dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the present at 6-hourly temporal and 2\textdegree{} spatial resolutions. Intercomparisons with independent radiosonde data indicate that the reanalyses are generally of high quality. The quality in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere throughout the century is similar to that of current three-day operational NWP forecasts. Intercomparisons over the second half-century of these surface-based reanalyses with other reanalyses that also make use of upper-air and satellite data are equally encouraging. It is anticipated that the 20CR dataset will be a valuable resource to the climate research community for both model validations and diagnostic studies. Some surprising results are already evident. For instance, the long-term trends of indices representing the North Atlantic Oscillation, the tropical Pacific Walker Circulation, and the Pacific\textendash{}North American pattern are weak or non-existent over the full period of record. The long-term trends of zonally averaged precipitation minus evaporation also differ in character from those in climate model simulations of the twentieth century.

  abstract = {Third International Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions Over the Earth Initiative Workshop: Reanalysis and Applications; Baltimore, Maryland, 3\textendash{}5 November 2010; The third Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth (ACRE) workshop advanced the goals of the international ACRE initiative (http://www.met-acre.org/) to undertake and facilitate the recovery of instrumental terrestrial and marine global surface weather observations underpinning global weather reconstructions and reanalyses spanning the past 200\textendash{}250 years (http://reanalyses.org). The workshop improved integration of the 35\textendash{}40 ACRE-linked international scientific projects, institutions, and organizations working toward these ends. The meeting highlighted the broad array and international usage of ACRE-facilitated data sets and reanalysis: the International Surface Pressure Databank (ISPD; http://dss.ucar.edu/datasets/ds132.0/), the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (http:/icoads.noaa.gov/ICOADS;), and the 20th Century Reanalysis (20CR; http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/20thC\_Rean/). The need for more data recovery for all regions of the globe during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was emphasized. Many regional efforts for such recovery are under way. The Arctic and maritime regions were highlighted as particular areas needing attention. As a result of the meeting, connections with existing projects were made and new efforts were started to address these needs.},

  abstract = {Migraine is the most common disabling brain disorder. Chronic migraine, a condition characterized by the experience of migrainous headache on at least 15 days per month, is highly disabling. Patients with chronic migraine present to primary care, are often referred for management to secondary care, and make up a large proportion of patients in specialist headache clinics. Many patients with chronic migraine also have medication overuse, defined as using a compound analgesic, opioid, triptan or ergot derivative on at least 10 days per month. All doctors will encounter patients with chronic headaches. A basic working knowledge of the common primary headaches, and a rational manner of approaching the patient with these conditions, allows a specific diagnosis of chronic migraine to be made quickly and safely, and by making this diagnosis one opens up a substantial number of acute and preventive treatment options. This article discusses the current state of management of chronic migraine.},

  title = {Operational {{Dataset Update Functionality Included}} in the {{NCAR Research Data Archive Management System}}},
  abstract = {Growing complexity, volume, and reliance on operationally created datasets poses challenges to the centers tasked with archiving and curating this information. Past tools focused on data delivered via media, such as tape, or data downloaded by single dataset customized ftp scripting. Presently nearly all data are acquired via network
interactions, which can happen many times per day. Prior archive
management technologies do not scale to this new paradigm. The Research Data Archive Management System (RDAMS) was developed to meet this challenge and has been implemented to support archive management within the Research Data Archive (RDA) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). RDAMS is driven by open source based databases and utilities, and is designed to support the complete data archive cycle by fetching, interrogating, archiving, and providing long-term research data stewardship. A good example of RDAMS functionality is found in the utility developed to specifically manage operational dataset updates, and can be applied to any dataset that requires periodic updating. The RDAMS dataset update utility (DSUPDT) accomplishes four basic tasks: 1) contact and query a remote server to see if new or modified data are available, 2) move data from a remote host to a local system and verify data transfer integrity, 3) execute any required data processing steps including metadata harvesting, 4) archive data to local disk and backup media systems. To accomplish these tasks across a diverse variety of datasets, DSUPDT incorporates a broad base of functionality. For
example, it can be configured to run according to many different data set requirements, handles multiple web protocols, automatically recovers from system outages at the remote or local site, can execute 3rd party data manipulation software, and accommodates irregular data delivery schedules. Currently over 150 RDA dataset products are configured to be under DSUPDT control, with datasets being updated at hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly intervals. DSUPDT is also fully scalable and
continues to support addition of new data streams. This paper will introduce the powerful functionality of the RDAMS for operational dataset updates, and provide examples of its use},

  abstract = {Category theory has provided the foundations for many of the twentieth century\&\#39;s greatest advances in pure mathematics. This concise, original text for a one-semester course on the subject is derived from courses that author Emily Riehl taught at Harvard and Johns Hopkins Universities. The treatment introduces the essential concepts of category theory: categories, functors, natural transformations, the Yoneda lemma, limits and colimits, adjunctions, monads, and other topics. Suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, the text provides tools for understanding and attacking difficult problems in algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology. Drawing upon a broad range of mathematical examples from the categorical perspective, the author illustrates how the concepts and constructions of category theory arise from and illuminate more basic mathematical ideas. Prerequisites are limited to familiarity with some basic set theory and logic.},

  abstract = {A Course in the Theory of Groups is a comprehensive introduction to the theory of groups - finite and infinite, commutative and non-commutative. Presupposing only a basic knowledge of modern algebra, it introduces the reader to the different branches of group theory and to its principal accomplishments. While stressing the unity of group theory, the book also draws attention to connections with other areas of algebra such as ring theory and homological algebra. This new edition has been updated at various points, some proofs have been improved, and lastly about thirty additional exercises are included. There are three main additions to the book. In the chapter on group extensions an exposition of Schreier's concrete approach via factor sets is given before the introduction of covering groups. This seems to be desirable on pedagogical grounds. Then S. Thomas's elegant proof of the automorphism tower theorem is included in the section on complete groups. Finally an elementary counterexample to the Burnside problem due to N.D. Gupta has been added in the chapter on finiteness properties.},
