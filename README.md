# dotfiles

These are configuration files for [software I use](http://coltongrainger.com/software). 

The version control is per [Nicola Paolucci's instructions](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/).

Rather than starting with sane defaults, I adopted *en masse* [Issa Rice's dotfiles](https://github.com/riceissa/dotfiles). The creativity is theirs and the mistakes are my own.

## License

I think the license is the same as `vim`'s.
