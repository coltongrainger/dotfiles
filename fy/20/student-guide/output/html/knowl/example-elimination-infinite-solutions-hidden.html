<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
2x+3y &amp;= 8\\
4x+6y &amp;= 16
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Once again, we attempt to solve the system by elimination, but the result is different. First multiply the first equation by \(2\text{:}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
2(2x + 3y &amp; = 8)\\
4x + 6y  &amp;= 16
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Subtract the second from the first:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
4x + 6y &amp; = 16\\
-\underline{(4x + 6y} &amp;\underline{\,= 16)}\\
0 &amp; = 0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>What happened that time? \(0 = 0\) no matter what \(x\) is. Instead of an equation that is always false, we have an equation that is always true. Does that mean these equations work for any \(x\) and \(y\text{?}\) Clearly not: for instance, \((1, 1)\) does not make either equation true. What this means is that the two equations are the same Any pair that solves one will also solve the other. There are an infinite number of solutions, but not all points are solutions.</p>
<p>To solve the system we need to state what values <em class="emphasis">are</em> solutions. These equations are the same line and its slope-intercept form is:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
2x + 3y &amp; = 8\\
3y &amp; = -2x + 8\\
y &amp; = -\frac{2}{3} x + \frac{8}{3}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Any point that is a solution to the line's equation is a solution for the system. Now, \(x\) may be any value, since any value of \(x\) may be substituted into the equation for a line-remember, a line's domain is all real numbers. The \(y\)-values are calculated by \(y = -\frac{2}{3} x + \frac{8}{3}.\)  So</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\left(-2, -\frac{2}{3}(-2) + \frac{8}{3}\right) = (2,4)\text{ is a solution as is }\left(1, -\frac{2}{3}(1) + \frac{8}{3}\right) = (1, 2).
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>In conclusion, we found that there are many solutions to this system of equations, but they have to look like \((x, -\frac{2}{3} x + \frac{8}{3}).\checkmark\)</p></article></body>
