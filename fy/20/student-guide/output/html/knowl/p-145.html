<p>These are obviously not chosen to be the simplest possible definitions. But they are chosen to be consistent with the behavior of positive-integer exponents. One way to see that consistency is to consider the following progression:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
19^4 = 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 1\\
19^3 = 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19\\
19^2 = 19 \cdot 19\\
19^1 = 19
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>What happens each time we decrease the exponent by \(1\text{?}\) Your first response might be “we have one less \(19\text{.}\)” But what is really happening, mathematically, to the numbers on the right? The answer is that, with each step, they are dividing by \(19\text{.}\) If you take \(19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19\text{,}\) and divide it by \(19\text{,}\) you get \(19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19\text{.}\) Divide that by \(19\) again, and you get \(19 \cdot 19\) \(\ldots\) and so on. From this we can formulate the following principle for the powers of \(19\text{:}\)</p>
