<p>Suppose \(A\) and \(B\) are two sets.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The <dfn class="terminology">intersection</dfn> of \(A\) and \(B\) contains the elements that are in BOTH sets: \(A \cap B = \{ x \; | \;  x \mbox{ is in } A \mbox{ and }  x \mbox{ is in } B\}.\)</p></li>
<li><p>The <dfn class="terminology">union</dfn> of \(A\) and \(B\) contains every element that occurs in AT LEAST ONE of the sets: \(A \cup B = \{ x \; | \;  x \mbox{ is in } A \mbox{ or }  x \mbox{ is in } B \mbox{ (or both)}\}.\)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Said differently, the intersection of two sets is the overlap of the two sets-all the elements which the sets both have in common. The union of two sets consists of the elements in both of the sets, collected together.</p>
