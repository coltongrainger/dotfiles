<p>Since the 1940s, mathematicians have described a special situation in which this warning is irrelevant as <dfn class="terminology">the First-year's Dream</dfn>. This situation occurs in a certain “number system” called a <dfn class="terminology">ring of characteristic \(p\)</dfn>. It's been considered bad practice to mention such number systems to first-years students, because in such systems, the rules of exponentiation are “too good to be true”. For example, the mathematician Saunders Mac Lane believed that a knowledge of \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\) in a ring of characteristic \(2\) would corrupt first-year students of algebra. Fortunately, the only number systems we will work with have characteristic \(0\text{,}\) in which case \((a + b)^0 = a^0 + b^0\text{,}\) a.k.a., \(1=1\text{.}\) But we already knew that, didn't we?</p>
