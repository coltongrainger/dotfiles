<p>Determine the equation for the vertical line through the point \((-2,5).\)</p>
<p>The slope of a vertical line is not defined since it has no change in the horizontal direction.  So, there is no value for the \(m\) in the slope-intercept form: \(y = mx+b\text{.}\) How can we proceed if we don't have a value to work with?</p>
<p>The defining aspect of a vertical line is the fact that all of it's \(x\)=coordinates are the same. In this case, the \(x\) values of all the points on the line are \(-2.\) So, the equation for the line is \(x = -2,\) since it tells all we need to know about “where” the line is and what it looks like.\(\checkmark\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="setting-up-coordinates.html#assemblage-quation-given-vertical">in-context</a></span>
