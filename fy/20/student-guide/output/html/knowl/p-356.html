<p>Once again, we attempt to solve the system by elimination, but the result is different. First multiply the first equation by \(2\text{:}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
2(2x + 3y &amp; = 8)\\
4x + 6y  &amp;= 16
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Subtract the second from the first:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
4x + 6y &amp; = 16\\
-\underline{(4x + 6y} &amp;\underline{\,= 16)}\\
0 &amp; = 0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>What happened that time? \(0 = 0\) no matter what \(x\) is. Instead of an equation that is always false, we have an equation that is always true. Does that mean these equations work for any \(x\) and \(y\text{?}\) Clearly not: for instance, \((1, 1)\) does not make either equation true. What this means is that the two equations are the same Any pair that solves one will also solve the other. There are an infinite number of solutions, but not all points are solutions.</p>
