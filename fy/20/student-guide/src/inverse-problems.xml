  <title><q>Inverse</q> Problems</title>

	<subsection>
		<title>Properties of Radicals</title>
		<p>What is <m>\sqrt{x^2 + 9}</m>? Many students will answer quickly that the answer is <m>(x + 3)</m> and have a very difficult time believing this answer is wrong. But it is wrong.</p>
		<p>For positive values of <m>x</m>, <m>\sqrt{x^2}</m> <em>is</em> <m>x</m> and <m>\sqrt{9}</m> <em>is</em> <m>3</m>, but <m>\sqrt{x^2 + 9}</m> is not <m>(x + 3).</m></p>
		<p>Why not? Remember that <m>\sqrt{x^2 + 9}</m> is asking a question: <q>what <em>squared</em> gives the answer <m>x^2 + 9</m>?</q> So <m>(x + 3)</m> is not an answer, because <m>(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x+9</m>, not <m>x^2 + 9</m>.</p>
		<p>As an example, suppose <m>x = 4</m>. Substituting into <m>\sqrt{x^2 + 9}</m> gives <m>\sqrt{4^2 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5</m>. But substituting into <m>(x + 3)</m> gives, <m>(4 + 3) = 7</m>.  That is, when <m>x = 4</m>:
		<md>
			<mrow>\sqrt{x^2 + 9} = \sqrt{4^2 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5\neq 7 = (4+3)=(x+3)</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>
	<p><alert>NOTE:</alert> If two numbers are added or subtracted under a square root, you cannot split them up. In symbols: <m>\sqrt{a + b} \neq \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}</m> or, to put it another way, <m>\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \neq x + y.</m></p>
	<p><m>\sqrt{x^2 + 9}</m> cannot, in fact, be simplified at all. It is a perfectly valid function, but cannot be rewritten in a simpler form.</p>
	<p>How about <m>\sqrt{9x^2}</m>? By analogy to the previous discussion, you might expect that this cannot be simplified either. But in fact, it can be simplified:
	<md>
		<mrow>\sqrt{9x^2} = 3x</mrow>
	</md>
		Why? Again, <m>\sqrt{9x^2}</m> is asking <q>what squared gives the answer <m>9x^2</m>?</q> The answer is <m>3x</m> because <m>(3x)^2 = 9x^2.</m></p>
	<p>Similarly, <m>\displaystyle \sqrt{\frac{9}{x^2}} = \frac{3}{x}</m> , because <m>\displaystyle \left(\frac{3}{x}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{x^2}</m>.</p>
	<p>There are radicals (or roots) other than a square root: <m>\sqrt[3]{27}</m> means <q>what number raised to the third power gives <m>27</m></q>.  In this case, <m>3^3=27</m> so <m>\sqrt[3]{27} = 3</m>.  Similarly, <m>\sqrt[4]{16} = 2.</m></p>

	<title>Radicals as Exponents</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>The way we generally consider exponents is as repeated multiplication: <m>10^6</m> means <m>10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10</m>. But this definition of exponents does not enable us to answer questions such as:
		<md>
			<mrow>4^0\amp = ??</mrow>
			<mrow>5^{-4}\amp =??</mrow>
			<mrow>9^{1/2}\amp = ??</mrow>
		</md>
			You can't <q>multiply <m>9</m> by itself half a time</q> or <q>multiply <m>5</m> by itself <m>-4</m> times.</q> We need a different way of considering the exponent in these cases.</p>

		<p>Note that you can combine these definitions. For instance, <m>8^{-2/3}</m> is a negative, fractional exponent. The negative exponent means, as always, "put me in the denominator." So we can write:
		<md>
			<mrow>8^{-2/3} = \frac{1}{8^{2/3}} = \frac{1}{(\sqrt[3]{8})^2} = \frac{1}{2^2} = \frac{1}{4}</mrow>
	</md></p>
</introduction>
<subsubsection>
	<title>OK, so why define exponents that way?</title>
	<p>These are obviously not chosen to be the simplest possible definitions. But they are chosen to be consistent with the behavior of positive-integer exponents. One way to see that consistency is to consider the following progression:
	<md>
		<mrow>19^4 = 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 1</mrow>
		<mrow>19^3 = 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19</mrow>
		<mrow>19^2 = 19 \cdot 19</mrow>
		<mrow>19^1 = 19</mrow>
	</md>
		What happens each time we decrease the exponent by <m>1</m>? Your first response might be <q>we have one less <m>19</m>.</q> But what is really happening, mathematically, to the numbers on the right? The answer is that, with each step, they are dividing by <m>19</m>. If you take <m>19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19</m>, and divide it by <m>19</m>, you get <m>19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19</m>. Divide that by <m>19</m> again, and you get <m>19 \cdot 19</m> <m>\ldots</m> and so on. From this we can formulate the following principle for the powers of <m>19</m>:</p>
	<p>Whenever you <em>subtract</em> <m>1</m> from the exponent, you <em>divide the answer</em> by <m>19.</m></p>
	<p>As we said earlier, we want the behavior of our new exponents to be consistent with the behavior of the old (positive-integer) exponents. So we can continue this progression as follows:
	<md>
		<mrow>19^1 \amp =19</mrow>
		<mrow>19^0 \amp =\frac{19}{19} = 1</mrow>
		<mrow>19^{-1} \amp = \frac{1}{19}</mrow>
		<mrow>19^{-2}  \amp = \frac{\frac{1}{19}}{19} = \frac{1}{19^2}</mrow>
	</md>
	<m>\ldots</m> and so on. We arrive at our definitions that anything to the zero power is <m>1</m> and negative exponents go to the denominator by simply requiring this progression to be consistent.</p>
<p>More rigorously, we can find all our exponent definitions by using the laws of exponents. For instance, what is <m>4^0</m>? We can approach this question indirectly by asking: what is <m>\dfrac{4^2}{4^2}</m>?
<ul>
	<li>The second law of exponents tells us that <m>\dfrac{4^2}{4^2} = 4^{2-2}</m>, which is <m>4^0</m>.</li>
	<li>But of course, <m>\dfrac{4^2}{4^2}</m> is just <m>\dfrac{16}{16}</m> , or <m>1</m>.</li>
	<li>Since <m>\dfrac{4^2}{4^2}</m> is both <m>4^0</m> and <m>1</m>, <m>4^0</m> and <m>1</m> must be the same thing!</li>
</ul>
		  </p>
		  <p>The proofs given below all follow this pattern. They use the laws of exponents to rewrite expressions such as <m>\frac{4^2}{4^2}</m> , and go on to show how zero, negative, and fractional exponents must be defined. We started with the definition of an exponent for a positive integer, <m>10^6 = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10</m>. From there, we developed the laws of exponents. Now we find that, if we want those same laws to apply to other kinds of exponents, there is only one correct way to define those other kinds of exponents.</p>

  <p>Now that we have a firm understanding of how to deal with expressions like <m>x^{n/m}</m> where <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> are integers, we could extend the idea to expressions like <m>x^r</m> where <m>r</m> is a real number. We will demonstrate how such a critter would be calculated, but not go into the mathematical underpinnings for the expression in this course. Let's see how one would go about calculating <m>2^\pi</m>. Recall that <m>\pi \approx 3.14159 \dots</m>. Consider
  <md>
	  <mrow>2^3 \amp =8</mrow>
	  <mrow>2^{3.1} \amp =2^{\frac{31}{10}} =  \sqrt[10]{2^{31}} = 8.5741877 \dots</mrow>
	  <mrow>2^{3.14} \amp =2^{\frac{314}{100}} =  \sqrt[100]{2^{314}} = 8.815241 \dots</mrow>
	  <mrow>2^{3.141} \amp =2^{\frac{3141}{1000}} =  \sqrt[1000]{2^{3141}} = 8.821353 \dots</mrow>
	  <mrow>2^{3.1415} \amp =2^{\frac{31415}{10000}} =  \sqrt[10000]{2^{31415}} = 8.824411 \dots</mrow>
	  <mrow>2^{3.14159} \amp =2^{\frac{314159}{100000}} =  \sqrt[100000]{2^{314159}} = 8.824962 \dots</mrow>
  </md>
	  As we use more digits of <m>\pi</m>, the digits of the result begin to stabilize.  Note that after the last calculation the first four digits haven't changed: <m>8.824</m>. We won't ever get an exact value for <m>2^\pi</m> since <m>\pi</m>'s digits don't repeat, but we can get as accurate a number as we need by using enough digits to calculate <m>2^\pi</m>.</p>

													  <title>Radical Equations</title>
													  <introduction>
														  <p>When solving equations that involve radicals, begin by asking yourself: is there an <m>x</m> under the square root? The answer to this question will determine the way you approach the problem.</p>
														  <p>If there is not an <m>x</m> under the square root <ndash/> if only numbers are under the radicals <ndash/> you can solve much the same way you would solve with no radicals at all.</p>
														  <example xml:id="example-solve-radical-equation">
															  <title>Solve a Radical Equation</title>
															  <p>Solve a radical equation with no variables under square root.</p>

																	  <mrow>x(\sqrt{2} +\sqrt{3})\amp = 2\amp\amp\text{Factor out the }x</mrow>
																	  <mrow>\amp\amp\amp\text{Divide, to solve for }x</mrow>
																	  <mrow>x\amp = \dfrac{2}{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}}\amp\amp\text{Our Solution}\checkmark</mrow>
																  </md>
															  </p>
														  </example>
														  <p>The key thing to note about such problems is that you do not have to square both sides of the equation. <m>\sqrt{ 2}</m> may look ugly, but it is just a number<ndash/>you could find it on your calculator if you wanted to<ndash/>it functions in the equation just the way that the number <m>10</m>, or <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> , or <m>\pi</m> would.</p>
														  <p>If there is an <m>x</m> under the square root, the problem is completely different. You will have to square both sides to get rid of the radical. However, there are two important notes about this kind of problem.
														  <ol>
															  <li>If possible, always get the radical alone, on one side of the equation, before squaring.</li>
															  <li>Squaring both sides can introduce false answers<ndash/>so it is important to check your answers after solving!</li>
														  </ol>
															  Both of these principles are demonstrated in the following example.</p>

															  </p>
														  </example>
														  <p>So the algebra yielded two solutions: <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> and <m>-1</m>. Checking, however, we discover that only the first solution is valid. This problem demonstrates how important it is to check solutions whenever squaring both sides of an equation.</p>
														  <p>If variables under the radical occur more than once, you will have to go through this procedure multiple times. Each time, you isolate a radical and then square both sides.</p>

																  <p>Remember, the key to this problem was recognizing that variables under the radical occurred in the original
																  problem two times. That cued us that we would have to go through the process<ndash />isolate a radical,
																  then square both sides<ndash />twice, before we could solve for <m>x</m>. And whenever you square both sides of the
																  equation, it's vital to check your answer(s)!</p>

															  <title>When Good Math Leads to Bad Answers</title>
															  <p>Why is it that<ndash/>when squaring both sides of an equation<ndash/>perfectly good algebra can lead to invalid solutions? The answer is in the redundancy of squaring. Consider the following equation:
															  <md>
																  <mrow>-5 = 5\text{, is false.}</mrow>
															  </md>
																  But square both sides, and we get...
															  <md>
																  <mrow>25 = 25\text{, which is true!}</mrow>
															  </md>
																  So squaring both sides of a false equation can produce a true equation.</p>
															  <p>To see how this affects our equations, try plugging <m>x = -1</m> into the various steps of <xref ref="example-rewrite-radical-2" text="type-global"/>:</p>
															  <p>
																  <md>
																	  <mrow>\sqrt{x + 2} + 3x\amp = 5x + 1\amp\amp\text{Does \(x = -1\) work here? No, it does not.}</mrow>
																	  <mrow>\sqrt{x + 2}\amp = 2x + 1\amp\amp\text{How about here? No, \(x = -1\) produces the false equation \(1 = -1\).}</mrow>
																	  <mrow>x + 2\amp = (2x + 1)^2\amp\amp\text{Suddenly, \(x = -1\) works. (Try it!)}</mrow>
																  </md>
															  </p>
															  <p>When we squared both sides, we <q>lost</q> the difference between <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>, and they <q>became equal.</q> From here on, when we solved, we ended up with <m>x = -1</m> as a valid solution. So, the moral of the story is if you square an equation in the course of solving it, you will need to check your answer to make sure a false one didn't sneak in.</p>
